    <h1>Welcome to Macquarie Statistical Consulting Hub!</h1>
    <p>This is a pilot of the Statistical Consulting Hub within the School of Mathematical and Physical Sciences at Macquarie University.</p>
    <p>Our initiative unites our top statisticians to provide tailored support for research, educational, and industry-facing projects. Whether you are refining a study design, interpreting complex results, or seeking specialised methodological advice, our team empowers you to generate high-quality, ethical, and impactful work. We support companies without in-house statisticians, translating complex problems into clear, actionable insights that enable stakeholders to understand their data and make informed decisions.</p>
    <p>Meet our team and learn more about our academic expertise:

    <p>We would love to learn more about your projects and explore how our expertise might support your goals. As an academic or external partner, you can tap into Macquarie’s world-class statistical expertise through this pilot. Together, we can unlock the potential of your data to create a lasting impact on society.</p>
